# VIBE-100 Technical Plan: Updated risks/mitigations shared with AI Steering Group

## Overview

This ticket establishes a structured governance cadence for sharing updated risk and mitigation information with the AI Steering Group through three milestone events (October, November, December). This is primarily a governance and communication task focused on stakeholder engagement, documentation preparation, and feedback incorporation.

## Technical Approach

### Governance Process Strategy

This task involves:

1. **Milestone Event Planning**: Structure three governance update sessions with clear objectives and deliverables
2. **Materials Preparation**: Compile risk/mitigation documentation in formats suitable for steering group consumption
3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Present updates, gather feedback, and document decisions
4. **Continuous Communication**: Maintain visibility between milestones through regular updates
5. **Decision Tracking**: Record all steering group guidance and ensure accountability

### Documentation Requirements

All governance documentation will be stored in SharePoint with links maintained in the project repository. This maintains separation between technical implementation and governance artifacts while ensuring accessibility for all stakeholders.

**Document Completeness**:
- [ ] All required materials prepared before each milestone
- [ ] Pre-read materials distributed 3 days before meetings
- [ ] Meeting notes capture all key decisions
- [ ] Action items have clear owners and deadlines
- [ ] Decision log maintains complete audit trail

**Communication Effectiveness**:

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Steering Group Availability
**Description**: Difficulty scheduling all steering group members across three milestones.

**Likelihood**: Medium (3)
**Impact**: High (4)
**Mitigation**:
- Schedule meetings 4-6 weeks in advance
- Offer multiple date options before finalizing
- Enable hybrid attendance (in-person + virtual)
- Record meetings for absent members
- Provide comprehensive pre-read materials
- Establish clear decision-making quorum

### Risk 2: Inadequate Preparation Time
**Description**: Insufficient time to prepare comprehensive materials between milestones.

**Likelihood**: Medium (3)
**Impact**: Medium (3)
**Mitigation**:
- Start preparation 2 weeks before each milestone
- Use templates to reduce preparation overhead
- Maintain continuous documentation throughout
- Assign dedicated preparation owners
- Build in buffer time for review cycles
- Establish clear preparation checklists

### Risk 3: Decision Documentation Gaps
**Description**: Steering group decisions not adequately captured or tracked.

**Likelihood**: Low (2)
**Impact**: High (4)
**Mitigation**:
- Assign dedicated note-taker for each meeting
- Use decision log template consistently
- Review and finalize notes within 24 hours
- Circulate notes for steering group validation
- Track action items with follow-up mechanism
- Maintain centralized decision repository

### Risk 4: Communication Breakdown
**Description**: Steering group loses visibility between formal milestones.

**Likelihood**: Low (2)
**Impact**: Medium (3)
**Mitigation**:
- Establish fortnightly email update cadence
- Use consistent communication templates
- Track acknowledgment of critical updates
- Escalate urgent issues immediately
- Maintain steering group distribution list
- Regular engagement check-ins

### Risk 5: Scope Creep in Governance
**Description**: Governance process becomes too heavyweight and bureaucratic.

**Likelihood**: Medium (3)
**Impact**: Medium (3)
**Mitigation**:
- Focus on decision-making value, not documentation volume
- Keep presentations concise (20-30 min)
- Limit pre-read materials to essentials
- Gather feedback on process effectiveness
- Streamline based on lessons learned
- Balance rigor with pragmatism

### Risk 6: Lack of Follow-Through on Action Items
**Description**: Action items from steering group meetings are not completed.

**Likelihood**: Low (2)
**Impact**: High (4)
**Mitigation**:
- Assign clear owners to all action items
- Include deadlines in action item log
- Track progress in fortnightly updates
- Escalate blocked items proactively
- Review action items at next milestone
- Maintain accountability and visibility
