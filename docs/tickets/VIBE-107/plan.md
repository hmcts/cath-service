# VIBE-107 Technical Plan: General Visibility of Work in SOW to TAB Community and AI Governance

## Overview

This ticket involves establishing a comprehensive communication and visibility strategy for the CATH AI governance work to the Technology Advisory Board (TAB) community and broader organizational AI governance structures. This is primarily a communication and stakeholder engagement task, with deliverables focused on documentation, presentation materials, and ongoing reporting mechanisms.

## Technical Approach

### Communication Strategy

This is a **stakeholder engagement and communication** task with the following approach:

1. **Stakeholder Mapping**: Identify and segment key audiences within TAB and AI governance communities
2. **Content Development**: Create briefing packages, presentations, and regular update materials
3. **Channel Integration**: Establish visibility through existing governance forums and community platforms
4. **Engagement Cadence**: Set up regular communication rhythm (monthly/quarterly updates)
5. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Create channels for community input and collaboration

### Communication Principles

- **Transparency**: Share progress, challenges, and learnings openly with the community
- **Accessibility**: Tailor messaging for different audiences (technical, executive, governance)
- **Consistency**: Maintain regular update cadence to build trust and awareness
- **Two-way dialogue**: Establish feedback mechanisms, not just broadcasting
- **Value-driven**: Focus on practical benefits and learnings that help the broader community

**Likelihood**: Medium (3)
**Impact**: High (4)
**Mitigation**:
- Secure executive sponsorship for briefings
- Clearly articulate value proposition for each audience
- Offer multiple engagement formats (live, recorded, written)
- Schedule at convenient times based on stakeholder availability
- Send compelling invitations with clear agenda
- Follow up with non-attendees offering alternative engagement

### Risk 2: Message Fragmentation
**Description**: Different audiences may receive inconsistent information about CATH work.

**Likelihood**: Medium (3)
**Impact**: Medium (3)
**Mitigation**:
- Maintain single source of truth in documentation
- Use templates to ensure consistency
- Coordinate all communications through single point of contact
- Version control for all materials
- Regular review of messaging for consistency
- Create FAQ document for common questions

### Risk 3: Feedback Overload
**Description**: Too much feedback from multiple sources may be difficult to process and respond to.

**Impact**: Medium (3)
**Mitigation**:
- Establish clear feedback channels and collection mechanisms
- Categorize feedback by theme and priority
- Set expectations for response times
- Triage feedback and focus on high-impact items
- Communicate how feedback is being used
- Document reasons when feedback cannot be incorporated

### Risk 4: Communication Fatigue
**Description**: Too frequent updates may lead to stakeholder disengagement or email fatigue.

**Impact**: Low (2)
**Mitigation**:
- Establish appropriate cadence (monthly, not weekly)
- Keep updates concise and scannable
- Use clear subject lines and executive summaries
- Offer opt-in for different levels of detail
- Monitor engagement metrics and adjust frequency
- Focus on high-value, actionable information

### Risk 5: Governance Channel Access Issues
**Description**: Difficulty securing time on governance committee agendas.

**Likelihood**: Medium (3)
**Impact**: Medium (3)
**Mitigation**:
- Start outreach early with governance committees
- Leverage executive sponsorship for access
- Be flexible on timing and format
- Offer to present in existing meeting time slots
- Provide executive summaries for committees to review asynchronously
- Build relationships with governance committee chairs

### Risk 6: Resource Constraints
**Description**: Insufficient time or resources to maintain ongoing communication and engagement.

**Likelihood**: Medium (3)
**Impact**: Medium (3)
**Mitigation**:
- Use templates to reduce preparation time
- Automate distribution where possible
- Batch similar communications
- Prioritize high-impact engagements
- Build communication time into project plan
- Share communication responsibilities across team
