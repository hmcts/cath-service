## Description

We need to enhance our CI/CD process by configuring a nightly pipeline and improving contributor documentation. This includes two main tasks:

---

### 1️⃣ Configure Nightly Pipeline
* Set up a nightly CI pipeline to run automatically at a scheduled time.

---

### 2️⃣ Update CLAUDE.md with Test Guidance

Add clear instructions on how to:
* Write e-2-e tests with new guidance
* Handle test data
* Expectations for test coverage
