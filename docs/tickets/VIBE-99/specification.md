# VIBE-99 Specification: KPI04 Evidential Pack using academic and market research

## Purpose
Develop a comprehensive evidential package for KPI04 (governance compliance/effectiveness metric) using rigorous academic research and market benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness of CATH's AI governance approach.

## Deliverables
1. **Academic Research Summary** - Key findings from peer-reviewed AI governance literature
2. **Market Benchmark Analysis** - Comparison against industry standards and best practices
3. **CATH Evidential Package (First Draft)** - Initial compilation with mid-October deadline
4. **Evidential Pack Updates** - Refined versions reflecting implementation experience (through Nov/Dec)
5. **KPI04 Metrics Framework** - How governance effectiveness will be measured

## Scope
- Conduct literature review of AI governance frameworks (academic sources)
- Benchmark CATH approach against industry and government standards
- Compile evidence of governance controls and mitigation effectiveness
- Establish metrics for ongoing governance measurement
- Document learning from implementation through end of year

## Research Areas
- Academic AI governance and risk management literature
- Industry standards (ISO, NIST, IEEE, etc.)
- Government AI governance frameworks
- Public sector case studies and lessons learned
- Regulatory requirements across UK/EU

## Timeline
- Weeks 1-3: Literature review and market research
- Week 4: First draft evidential package (mid-October)
- Ongoing: Refinement based on implementation experience
- Week 12: Final updated package (Nov/Dec)

## Success Criteria
- 20+ academic sources reviewed and synthesized
- Evidential pack addresses all KPI04 assessment criteria
- Benchmarking shows CATH aligned with/exceeding standards
- First draft submitted mid-October as committed
- Updates reflect real implementation experience
- Governance effectiveness demonstrably measurable
