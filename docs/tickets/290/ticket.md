## Description

> **Migrated from [VIBE-270](https://tools.hmcts.net/jira/browse/VIBE-270)**

#### User story

**As a** developer, I want to integrate lint and TypeScript validation into our pre-merge checks, so that we can identify and fix issues before they trigger a PR build failure.

We are currently doing it for existing CaTH.

#### Acceptance criteria
- Make sure there is no lint and typescript error in code before pushing to Github
