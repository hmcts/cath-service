# VIBE-98 Specification: Deliver mitigations not covered by SOW030

## Purpose
Identify and implement AI governance mitigations that fall outside SOW030 scope, ensuring comprehensive coverage of HMCTS-specific governance requirements.

## Deliverables
1. **SOW030 Gap Analysis** - Document mitigations not covered by SOW030 streams
2. **CATH-Specific Mitigation Register** - Policies and controls unique to this service
3. **Implementation Status Review** - Current state assessment of all mitigations
4. **Policy Documentation** - Governance policies (e.g., AI code-review policy)
5. **Implementation Roadmap** - Plan for completing outstanding mitigations

## Scope
- Analyze coverage of SOW030 work streams against CATH requirements
- Identify gaps requiring CATH-specific solutions
- Review current HMCTS AI governance implementations
- Document CATH-specific policies and controls
- Assess implementation status of existing mitigations

## Key Areas
- AI code review policy and standards
- HMCTS-specific governance controls
- Service-level AI risk management
- CATH-specific compliance requirements
- Documentation and audit trails

## Success Criteria
- All mitigations mapped (both SOW030-covered and CATH-specific)
- Gap analysis completed with no ambiguities
- At least 3 key CATH-specific policies documented
- Implementation status clear for each mitigation
- Roadmap aligns with AI Steering Group expectations
