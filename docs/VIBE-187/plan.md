# VIBE-187: Implementation Plan

## Objective

Create comprehensive educational materials on satisfaction and trust metrics for the VIBE pilot program.

## Approach

### Phase 1: Content Structure (Completed)

Define the document structure to ensure logical flow and completeness:

1. **Introduction Section**
   - Purpose and scope
   - Target audience
   - How to use the materials

2. **Core Metrics Section**
   - Comments per pull request
   - Survey results analysis
   - Developer experience
   - Business team experience

3. **Implementation Section**
   - How metrics are collected in VIBE pilot
   - Tools and processes
   - Data analysis approaches

4. **Success Criteria Section**
   - Benchmarks for each metric
   - Warning signs
   - Best practices

### Phase 2: Content Development (In Progress)

#### 2.1 Metric Definitions
- Research existing metric definitions
- Define each metric in clear, accessible language
- Explain why each metric matters

#### 2.2 VIBE Pilot Mapping
- Document current metric collection methods
- Describe integration with existing workflows
- Identify data sources and tools

#### 2.3 Success Criteria Definition
- Establish what "good" looks like for each metric
- Define threshold values where applicable
- Create interpretation guidelines

#### 2.4 Practical Examples
- Develop realistic survey question examples
- Create sample comment analysis scenarios
- Illustrate metric interpretation

### Phase 3: Review and Refinement (Planned)

1. **Technical Review**
   - Verify accuracy of metric definitions
   - Validate technical implementation details
   - Check code and tool references

2. **Usability Review**
   - Test with non-technical readers
   - Ensure clarity for all audiences
   - Refine language and examples

3. **Stakeholder Review**
   - Present to product owner
   - Gather feedback from development team
   - Incorporate business perspective

### Phase 4: Finalization (Planned)

1. **Documentation**
   - Final formatting and proofreading
   - Add cross-references where helpful
   - Ensure consistent terminology

2. **Integration**
   - Link from main VIBE pilot documentation
   - Add to onboarding materials
   - Share with team

- Use actual or anonymized data where possible
- Show both good and problematic examples
- Include interpretation guidance

### Technical Accuracy

- Verify all metric definitions
- Validate calculation methods
- Cross-check with VIBE pilot documentation
- Cite sources where appropriate

## Review Checkpoints

### Self-Review Checklist

- [ ] All required metrics are covered
- [ ] Explanations are clear for non-technical readers
- [ ] Examples are practical and realistic
- [ ] Success criteria are well-defined
- [ ] VIBE pilot implementation is accurately described
- [ ] Formatting is consistent
- [ ] No jargon without definitions
- [ ] Links and references are valid

### Peer Review Focus Areas

- Completeness of metric coverage
- Accuracy of technical details
- Usefulness of examples
- Practical applicability

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Phase 1: Structure | 0.5 hours | Complete |
| Phase 2: Development | 2 hours | In Progress |
| Phase 3: Review | 1 hour | Planned |
| Phase 4: Finalization | 0.5 hours | Planned |

**Total Estimated Time**: 4 hours

## Success Metrics

The plan will be considered successful when:

1. **Deliverables Complete**
   - All three documents created
   - Content meets specification requirements
   - Materials pass review process

2. **Quality Standards Met**
   - Clear and accessible to all audiences
   - Technically accurate
   - Practically useful

3. **Stakeholder Acceptance**
   - Approved by technical lead
   - Endorsed by product owner
   - Validated by development team

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks

1. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Attempting to cover too many metrics or scenarios
   - Mitigation: Stick to specified metrics, note future enhancements separately

2. **Technical Accuracy**
   - Risk: Misrepresenting metric definitions or calculations
   - Mitigation: Cross-reference with VIBE pilot documentation, seek technical review

3. **Accessibility**
   - Risk: Content too technical for non-technical readers
   - Mitigation: Test with diverse audience, simplify language iteratively

## Next Steps

1. Complete content development for educational-materials.md
2. Self-review against specification requirements
3. Submit for peer review
4. Incorporate feedback
5. Finalize and commit to repository
6. Link from main VIBE pilot documentation
