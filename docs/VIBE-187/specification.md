# VIBE-187: Educational Materials - Satisfaction & Trust

## Overview

This specification defines the requirements for creating educational materials about satisfaction and trust metrics used in the VIBE pilot program. These materials will serve as both teaching resources and reference documentation for team members.

## Context

The VIBE pilot aims to measure the effectiveness and impact of AI-assisted development tools. Satisfaction and trust metrics are critical indicators of:
- Developer confidence in AI-generated code
- Team collaboration quality
- Overall developer experience
- Business stakeholder satisfaction

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Metric Explanations**
   - Provide clear definitions of each satisfaction and trust metric
   - Explain the rationale for selecting each metric
   - Describe how each metric contributes to overall program assessment

2. **Metric Coverage**
   The materials must cover:
   - Number of comments per pull request
   - Quantitative survey results (numerical ratings and scores)
   - Developer experience metrics
   - Business team experience metrics

3. **Practical Application**
   - Document how metrics are implemented in the VIBE pilot
   - Provide concrete examples of metric collection and analysis
   - Include sample survey questions and comment analysis approaches

4. **Success Criteria**
   - Define "what good looks like" for each metric
   - Establish baseline expectations
   - Identify red flags and warning signs

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Accessibility**
   - Content must be understandable by both technical and non-technical audiences
   - Avoid unnecessary jargon; define technical terms when used
   - Use clear headings and structure for easy navigation

2. **Completeness**
   - Cover all aspects of satisfaction and trust measurement
   - Balance quantitative and qualitative perspectives
   - Include practical examples and real-world scenarios

3. **Maintainability**
   - Use markdown format for version control and easy updates
   - Structure content logically for future expansion
   - Include clear sections that can be updated independently

## Deliverables

1. **specification.md** (this document)
   - Requirements and scope definition
   - Success criteria for the documentation

2. **plan.md**
   - Execution approach
   - Content structure and organization
   - Review and approval process

3. **educational-materials.md**
   - Complete educational materials on satisfaction and trust metrics
   - Practical examples and use cases
   - Success criteria definitions

## Target Audience

### Primary Audiences
- Development team members working with AI tools
- Engineering managers and technical leads
- Product owners and business stakeholders

### Secondary Audiences
- New team members onboarding to the VIBE pilot
- External stakeholders interested in metrics methodology
- Future teams implementing similar measurement frameworks

## Success Criteria

The educational materials will be considered successful when:

1. **Comprehension**
   - Team members can explain what each metric measures
   - Stakeholders understand why these metrics were chosen
   - Readers can apply metrics to their own work

2. **Utility**
   - Materials are referenced during metric reviews
   - Content reduces questions about metric definitions
   - Examples clarify practical application

3. **Adoption**
   - Team members use the materials for onboarding
   - Metrics are consistently applied across the pilot
   - Feedback leads to continuous improvement

## Dependencies

- Access to VIBE pilot program documentation
- Understanding of current metric collection processes
- Familiarity with team collaboration practices

## Constraints

- Must align with existing HMCTS documentation standards
- Should complement (not duplicate) existing program documentation
- Must be completed within the current sprint cycle

## Approval Criteria

Materials must be reviewed and approved by:
- Technical lead for accuracy
- Product owner for business alignment
- At least one developer for clarity and usability

## Maintenance Plan

- Review quarterly for relevance and accuracy
- Update based on pilot findings and feedback
- Incorporate lessons learned from metric application
