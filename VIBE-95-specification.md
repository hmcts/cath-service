# VIBE-95: Updated risks for vibe coding - Specification

## Problem Statement
Update risks for vibe coding and share in SharePoint to allow updates over rest of project.

## User Story
**AS A** Project Manager
**I WANT** to maintain an up-to-date risks document for the VIBE coding project in SharePoint
**SO THAT** stakeholders can access and update risks throughout the project lifecycle

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive risks document created covering VIBE coding activities
- [ ] Document identifies key risk categories (technical, delivery, security, compliance)
- [ ] Each risk includes description, likelihood, impact, and current status
- [ ] Document shared in appropriate SharePoint location with correct permissions
- [ ] Stakeholders notified of document location and purpose
- [ ] Document format allows for easy updates and version control

## Technical Context
This is a documentation task, not a code implementation. The deliverable is a living document that will be maintained throughout the project.

## Risk Categories to Cover
1. **Technical Risks**
   - AI code generation quality and reliability
   - Integration with existing systems
   - Performance and scalability concerns
   - Technical debt accumulation

2. **Delivery Risks**
   - Timeline constraints
   - Resource availability
   - Dependency on external teams/systems
   - Scope creep

3. **Security Risks**
   - Code security vulnerabilities
   - Data protection and privacy
   - Access control and authentication
   - Audit trail requirements

4. **Compliance Risks**
   - Regulatory requirements
   - Internal policies and standards
   - Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)
   - AI governance requirements

## SharePoint Requirements
- Document accessible to all project stakeholders
- Version control enabled
- Appropriate folder structure
- Link to be shared with AI Steering Group
- Regular review schedule established

## Out of Scope
- Implementation of risk mitigation strategies (covered in VIBE-96)
- Automated risk tracking systems
- Integration with JIRA risk fields
