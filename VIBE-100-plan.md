   - Escalate delays
   - Update status

3. **Material maintenance** (2 hours/month):
   - Keep documents current
   - Update dashboards
   - Refine presentation approach
   - Incorporate feedback

4. **Ad-hoc communications** (as needed):
   - Urgent issues requiring steering group input
   - Quick approvals between meetings
   - Status updates if requested

## Technical Decisions

**Meeting Frequency**: Monthly milestones provide appropriate oversight without micromanagement.

**Materials Timing**: Distribute 1 week before to allow review; more time reduces urgency, less time insufficient for review.

**Decision Documentation**: Formal minutes and decision log ensure accountability and traceability.

**Visual Communication**: Use dashboards and RAG status for quick executive understanding; detailed documents as backup.
