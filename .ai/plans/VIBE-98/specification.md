# VIBE-98: Deliver mitigations not covered by SOW030 - Specification

## Problem Statement
Delivery on mitigations not covered by SOW030 (e.g. AI code-review policy) - Review of current implementation status within HMCTS.

## User Story
**AS A** Project Manager
**I WANT** to identify and deliver risk mitigations that fall outside SOW030 work streams
**SO THAT** all identified risks have appropriate mitigation coverage regardless of work stream boundaries

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Mitigations not covered by SOW030 identified from VIBE-96
- [ ] Current HMCTS implementation status reviewed for each mitigation
- [ ] Gap analysis completed
- [ ] Delivery plan created for uncovered mitigations
- [ ] Resource and budget requirements identified
- [ ] Example: AI code-review policy drafted and approved
- [ ] All standalone mitigations implemented or scheduled
- [ ] Implementation status tracked and reported

## Technical Context
After embedding mitigations with SOW030 work streams (VIBE-97), some mitigations will remain that don't fit neatly into existing work streams. These require direct delivery by the VIBE project team, such as:
- AI code-review policy
- Training materials
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Documentation standards
- Specific tools or processes

## Mitigation Categories Outside SOW030

### 1. Policy and Governance
- AI code generation usage policy
- AI code review requirements
- Data handling guidelines
- Quality standards for AI-generated code
- Approval processes

### 2. Training and Awareness
- Developer training on AI tools
- Code review training for AI-generated code
- Security awareness for AI risks
- Best practices documentation

### 3. Tools and Infrastructure
- Code quality monitoring tools
- AI-specific linters or validators
- Metrics and reporting dashboards
- Audit logging mechanisms

### 4. Process and Standards
- Code review checklists for AI code
- Testing requirements for AI-generated code
- Documentation standards
- Change management procedures

## Current Implementation Status Review

For each mitigation, document:
- **Current State**: What's already in place at HMCTS?
- **Gap**: What's missing or inadequate?
- **Priority**: How urgently is this needed?
- **Effort**: How much work to implement?
- **Dependencies**: What's needed first?

## Example: AI Code-Review Policy

**Objective**: Establish clear policy for reviewing AI-generated code

**Policy Components**:
- When AI code generation can be used
- Required review process for AI-generated code
- Additional security checks needed
- Documentation requirements
- Approval authorities
- Non-compliance consequences

**Current Status at HMCTS**: [To be determined]
**Gaps**: [To be identified]
**Implementation**: Draft policy → Stakeholder review → Approval → Publication → Training

## Out of Scope
- Mitigations already covered by SOW030 work streams (handled in VIBE-97)
- Program-wide governance changes requiring executive approval
- Long-term operational support (beyond initial implementation)

## Dependencies
- VIBE-96: Mitigations must be documented
- VIBE-97: SOW030 coverage must be determined first
- Access to HMCTS current policies and standards
- Budget and resource allocation

## Success Metrics
- Number of standalone mitigations identified
- Percentage of mitigations with gap analysis completed
- Number of policies/procedures delivered
- Adoption rate of new policies and training
- Risk reduction achieved through mitigation delivery
