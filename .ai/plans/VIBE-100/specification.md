# VIBE-100 Specification: Updated risks/mitigations shared with AI Steering Group

## Problem Statement

Governance as needed - Updated risks/mitigations shared with AI Steering Group, but need milestone events identified for October, November, and December to enable structured oversight and decision-making.

## User Story

**AS A** Program Lead
**I WANT** to establish regular governance with the AI Steering Group through milestone events
**SO THAT** risks and mitigations are reviewed, guidance is provided, and decisions are made at appropriate intervals

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Milestone events identified for October, November, and December
- [ ] Agenda and materials defined for each milestone
- [ ] AI Steering Group meetings scheduled
- [ ] Risks and mitigations register prepared for each milestone
- [ ] Supporting materials and presentations created
- [ ] Milestone reviews conducted with AI Steering Group
- [ ] Decisions and actions documented
- [ ] Follow-up actions tracked and completed
- [ ] Regular reporting cadence established

## Context

   - Critical issues or decisions needed
   - Overall project health

2. **Risks and Mitigations Review** (20 mins)
   - RAG status of key risks
   - Mitigation progress
   - New or emerging risks
   - Escalations

3. **Progress Updates** (30 mins)
   - KPI04 evidence
   - SOW030 collaboration
   - Mitigation delivery
   - Key milestones achieved

4. **Discussion and Decisions** (20 mins)
   - Address issues
   - Make required decisions
   - Provide guidance
   - Approve next steps

5. **Actions and Next Steps** (10 mins)
   - Document decisions
   - Assign actions
   - Confirm next meeting

### Post-Meeting Follow-up (1-2 days after)
- Distribute meeting minutes
- Document decisions
- Assign action owners
- Update project plans
- Communicate outcomes

## Materials Required for Each Milestone

### Core Documents
- **Risks/Mitigations Register**: Current status with RAG ratings
- **Executive Summary**: 1-2 page overview
- **Progress Dashboard**: Visual metrics and KPIs
- **Issues Log**: Active issues and escalations

### Supporting Materials (as relevant)
- KPI04 evidence pack updates
- SOW030 collaboration plan
- Mitigation delivery status reports
- Project metrics and trends
- Lessons learned
- Recommendations

### Presentation Deck
- 10-15 slides maximum
- Executive-friendly visuals
- Clear calls to action
- Decision points highlighted

## Decision Points for Steering Group

Examples of decisions needed:
- Approval of risk mitigation strategies
- Resource allocation for critical mitigations
- Escalation of blocked items
- Scope or timeline adjustments
- Strategic direction changes
- Budget approvals
- Policy or governance changes

## Out of Scope

- Day-to-day project management (handled by project team)
- Detailed technical decisions (delegated to appropriate level)
- Implementation execution (steering group provides oversight, not execution)

## Dependencies

- VIBE-95: Risks register must exist
- VIBE-96: Mitigations must be documented
- VIBE-99: KPI04 evidence pack for updates
- AI Steering Group availability and meeting schedule
- Access to meeting facilities or virtual meeting platform

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Documentation Standards
- All materials in GOV.UK accessible format where applicable
- Clear, executive-level language
- Visual dashboards for quick comprehension
- Version control for all governance documents

### Communication Standards
- Materials distributed 1 week before meetings
- Meeting minutes within 2 days of meeting
- Action tracking with clear owners and deadlines
- Regular status updates between milestones

### Decision Documentation
- All decisions recorded with rationale
- Decision log maintained throughout project
- Decisions communicated to affected stakeholders
- Impact of decisions tracked
