# VIBE-100 Implementation Plan: AI Steering Group Governance Milestones

## Summary

Establish regular governance through milestone events in October, November, and December where updated risks and mitigations are reviewed by the AI Steering Group, enabling strategic oversight and decision-making.

## Approach

This is a **governance and documentation activity**, not a code implementation. The work involves establishing a governance rhythm, preparing materials, conducting meetings, and documenting decisions. No technical changes to the codebase are required.

## Key Phases

### Phase 1: Milestone Planning and Framework Setup (1 week - September)

**Objective**: Establish the governance framework and schedule all three milestone events.

#### Activities:

1. **Define milestone objectives** (0.5 days)
   - October: Baseline and approval
   - November: Progress and course correction
   - December: Final review and lessons learned

2. **Schedule meetings** (0.5 days)
   - Coordinate with AI Steering Group calendars
   - Book meeting rooms or virtual facilities
   - Send calendar invitations
   - Confirm attendance

3. **Create governance framework** (1 day)
   - Meeting structure template
   - Agenda format
   - Materials checklist
   - Decision log template
   - Action tracking format

**Deliverables**:
- Three meetings scheduled with confirmed dates
- Governance framework documentation
- Templates for materials and documentation

## Technical Decisions

### Meeting Frequency
**Decision**: Monthly milestones provide appropriate oversight without micromanagement.
**Rationale**: Allows time for progress between reviews while maintaining visibility.

### Materials Timing
**Decision**: Distribute 1 week before meetings.
**Rationale**: More time reduces urgency; less time insufficient for review.

### Decision Documentation
**Decision**: Formal minutes and decision log.
**Rationale**: Ensures accountability and traceability.

### Visual Communication
**Decision**: Use dashboards and RAG status for quick executive understanding.
**Rationale**: Detailed documents as backup; executives need quick comprehension.

---

## Resource Requirements

- **Program Lead**: 3 days/month for milestone preparation
- **Project Team**: 1 day/month for materials updates
- **AI Steering Group**: 2 hours/month for meetings
- **Administrative Support**: 0.5 days/month for logistics
- **Tools**: Presentation software, meeting facilities/platform

---

## Dependencies

- VIBE-95/96: Risks and mitigations register
- VIBE-99: KPI04 evidence pack
- VIBE-97/98: Mitigation delivery progress
- AI Steering Group availability
- Access to project data and metrics

---

## Risks

### Risk 1: Steering Group Availability
**Impact**: Cannot hold milestone meetings
**Mitigation**: Schedule meetings early with confirmed attendance; have backup dates

### Risk 2: Incomplete Materials
**Impact**: Poor quality reviews and decisions
**Mitigation**: Start preparation 2 weeks before; have checklist and clear owners

### Risk 3: Lack of Decisions
**Impact**: Project cannot progress
**Mitigation**: Clear decision points in materials; escalation path defined

### Risk 4: Poor Communication
**Impact**: Stakeholders not informed
**Mitigation**: Communication plan with clear timelines and channels
