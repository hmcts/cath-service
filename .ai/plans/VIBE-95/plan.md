# VIBE-95: Updated risks for vibe coding - Implementation Plan

## Summary
Create and publish a comprehensive risks register for the VIBE coding project in SharePoint, covering technical, delivery, security, and compliance risks to enable ongoing stakeholder visibility and updates throughout the project lifecycle.

## Key Implementation Points

### Phase 1: Risk Identification and Analysis (2 hours)
1. Review project scope and objectives
2. Identify risks across all categories:
   - Technical (AI quality, integration, performance)
   - Delivery (timeline, resources, dependencies)
   - Security (vulnerabilities, data protection, access control)
   - Compliance (regulations, policies, accessibility, AI governance)
3. Assess likelihood and impact for each risk
4. Determine current mitigation status

### Phase 2: Document Creation (1.5 hours)
1. Create risks register using appropriate template
2. Structure document for easy navigation:
   - Executive summary
   - Risk categories with detailed entries
   - Risk matrix/heatmap visualization
   - Review schedule and ownership
3. Ensure format supports:
   - Version control
   - Comments and collaborative editing
   - Export capabilities

### Phase 3: SharePoint Setup (0.5 hours)
1. Identify appropriate SharePoint site and folder
2. Upload document with correct naming convention
3. Configure permissions for stakeholder access
4. Enable version history
5. Set up document metadata and tags

### Phase 4: Stakeholder Communication (1 hour)
1. Prepare communication about risks register
2. Share SharePoint link with:
   - Project team
   - AI Steering Group
   - Relevant management
3. Schedule initial review session
4. Establish regular review cadence (e.g., fortnightly)
5. Define update process and ownership

## Technical Decisions

**Document Format**: Use Microsoft Word or Excel in SharePoint for native collaboration features and version control.

**Risk Scoring**: Use standard 5x5 matrix (likelihood x impact) for consistent risk assessment.

**Review Cadence**: Fortnightly reviews during active development, monthly during maintenance.

## Dependencies
- Access to appropriate SharePoint site
- List of stakeholders for distribution
- Understanding of project scope and technical architecture
