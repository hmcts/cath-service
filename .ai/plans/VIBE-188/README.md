# VIBE-188: Educational Materials - Quality

## Ticket Summary
Create comprehensive educational materials explaining quality metrics for the VIBE pilot, helping stakeholders understand how we measure code quality, why these metrics matter, and what indicates good performance.

## Planning Documents

### [specification.md](./specification.md)
Detailed requirements and acceptance criteria for the educational materials, including:
- Six quality metrics (Test Coverage, CVEs, Duplicated Lines, Maintainability, Reliability, Security)
- What each metric measures and why it matters
- How we map metrics in the VIBE pilot
- What good performance looks like
- Document structure and visual aids
- Scope and dependencies

### [plan.md](./plan.md)
Technical implementation approach covering:
- Five implementation phases (Research, Content Development, Visual Design, Review, Publication)
- Detailed content strategy for each metric
- Visual design approach using Mermaid diagrams
- Technical decisions and rationale
- Resource requirements (13.5 days across team)
- Quality metrics summary table
- Risks and mitigations

### [tasks.md](./tasks.md)
Actionable task breakdown with 30 specific tasks:
- Phase 1: Research and Content Planning (4 tasks, 16 hours)
- Phase 2: Content Development (12 tasks, 54 hours)
- Phase 3: Visual Design (6 tasks, 16 hours)
- Phase 4: Review and Refinement (4 tasks, 24 hours)
- Phase 5: Finalization and Publication (4 tasks, 9 hours)
- Each task includes effort estimate, owner, deliverable, subtasks, and exit criteria

## Key Deliverables
1. Comprehensive educational document (20-25 pages)
2. Six quality metrics explained in depth
3. VIBE pilot implementation documentation
4. Visual aids (diagrams, dashboards, examples)
5. Case studies with practical scenarios
6. FAQ and resources section

## Success Criteria
- Technical accuracy verified by SMEs
- Accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All six metrics clearly explained with "what good looks like"
- Published and distributed to all stakeholders
- Added to VIBE artefacts register

## Timeline
- Estimated duration: 15 working days distributed across team
- Critical path includes sequential research, content development, review phases
