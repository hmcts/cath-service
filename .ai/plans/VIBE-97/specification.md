# VIBE-97 Specification: Working with SOW030 to embed mitigations

## Overview
Collaborate with SOW030 work streams to embed AI governance mitigations across the CATH service. This involves mapping CATH mitigations to SOW030 deliverables, establishing integration points, and presenting a first draft governance package to the AI Steering Group.

## Problem Statement
The CATH service needs to ensure risk mitigations align with broader SOW030 work streams to create a cohesive, cross-cutting governance approach. Without coordination, mitigations may be duplicated, conflict, or create gaps in coverage.

## User Story
**AS A** Project Manager
**I WANT** to collaborate with SOW030 work streams to embed risk mitigations
**SO THAT** risk management is integrated across the broader program and consistently applied

## Business Context
SOW030 represents parallel work streams within the AI/digital transformation program. This ticket ensures VIBE's coding mitigations are appropriately embedded in related work, avoiding siloed approaches and ensuring steering group oversight.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Mitigation Alignment Document
A comprehensive mapping showing:
- All CATH mitigations categorized by type (technical, process, governance)
- Corresponding SOW030 work streams
- Integration type (policy, process, technical, governance)
- Priority level based on risk severity
- Primary and secondary ownership

### 2. Integration Points Documentation
Detailed register covering:
- Specific convergence points between CATH and SOW030
- Coordination model and responsibilities
- Feedback loops between teams
- Escalation paths for conflicts
- Implementation coordination checklist

### 3. First Draft Governance Package
Includes:
- Executive summary of mitigation strategy
- Work stream mapping matrix
- Engagement strategy for each stream
- Timeline with phased rollout
- Success metrics
- Governance reporting structure
- Risk and dependency analysis
- Visual aids (flowcharts, matrices, timelines)

### 4. Stakeholder Feedback Log
Structured tracking of:
- AI Steering Group feedback and concerns
- Work stream lead input
- Gap analysis results
- Action items with owners and deadlines

## Scope

### In Scope
- Identifying overlaps between CATH and SOW030 mitigation approaches
- Documenting shared standards and compatible practices
- Preparing governance materials for steering group review
- Establishing feedback mechanism for ongoing input
- Creating engagement plans for each SOW030 work stream
- Defining integration mechanisms (policy, process, technical, governance)
- Initial stakeholder meetings and briefings

### Out of Scope
- Delivering mitigations not covered by SOW030 (VIBE-98)
- Detailed technical implementation of specific mitigations
- Full execution of mitigation embedding (this is planning phase)
- Creating new SOW030 work streams
- Changing SOW030 governance structures

## SOW030 Work Streams (To be confirmed)
Expected work streams may include:
- AI Platform Development
- Data Infrastructure & Management
- Security & Compliance
- Testing & Quality Assurance
- Training & Documentation
- Infrastructure & DevOps
- Analytics & Monitoring

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Analysis Complete
- All SOW030 work streams identified and documented
- All CATH mitigations analyzed and categorized
- Mapping matrix created showing all relationships

- Support mechanisms defined
- Communication channels established

### Phase 3: Governance Package Ready
- First draft completed with all required sections
- Visual aids created and reviewed
- Quality review passed
- Formatted per AI Steering Group requirements
- Presentation materials prepared

### Phase 4: Steering Group Review
- Package submitted by week 5

- All feedback documented
- Action items assigned
- Next steps agreed

### Phase 5: Alignment Confirmed
- SOW030 leads have acknowledged alignment in writing
- No outstanding critical concerns from steering group
- Foundations established for ongoing coordination
- Progress tracking mechanism operational

## Key Outcomes
- SOW030 alignment confirmed in writing
- AI Steering Group has reviewed and provided feedback on initial package
- Clear integration points documented for implementation teams
- Coordination model established between CATH and SOW030
- Risk coverage gaps identified and mitigation plans agreed

## Timeline

### Weeks 1-2: Discovery and Mapping
- Obtain SOW030 documentation
- Analyze CATH mitigations
- Create comprehensive mapping matrix
- Identify work stream leads

### Weeks 3-4: Engagement and Draft Preparation
- Initial meetings with work stream leads
- Document integration approaches
- Prepare first draft governance package
- Create visual aids and supporting materials

### Week 5: Steering Group Submission
- Submit governance package
- Present to AI Steering Group
- Document feedback
- Define next steps

### Ongoing: Coordination
- Regular check-ins with work stream leads
- Progress monitoring
- Issue resolution
- Steering group updates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SOW030 work streams identified and mapped to CATH mitigations
- [ ] Engagement plan created for each SOW030 work stream
- [ ] Mitigation embedding approach documented for each work stream
- [ ] Integration points clearly defined with ownership
- [ ] First draft governance package complete with all sections
- [ ] Visual aids prepared (mapping matrix, flowcharts, timelines)
- [ ] Package submitted to AI Steering Group
- [ ] Feedback from AI Steering Group documented
- [ ] Work stream leads briefed and committed to approach
- [ ] Progress tracking mechanism established
- [ ] No critical gaps or conflicts unresolved

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- VIBE-96: Updated mitigations must be documented
- Access to SOW030 documentation and work stream plans
- Availability of work stream leads for meetings
- AI Steering Group meeting schedule confirmed

### Related Work
- VIBE-98: Deliver mitigations not covered by SOW030
- VIBE-100: Updated risks/mitigations shared with AI Steering Group

### External Dependencies
- Project sponsor to provide SOW030 documentation
- Work stream leads availability for engagement
- AI Steering Group capacity for review
- SOW030 governance mechanisms and processes

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: SOW030 documentation not available
**Impact**: Cannot create accurate mapping
**Mitigation**: Escalate to project sponsor immediately

### Risk: Work stream leads unavailable
**Impact**: Delays in engagement phase
**Mitigation**: Identify delegates, adjust timeline, escalate if needed

### Risk: Conflicting approaches between CATH and SOW030
**Impact**: Duplicated effort or gaps in coverage
**Mitigation**: Document conflicts, present options to steering group for resolution

### Risk: Steering group feedback requires major rework
**Impact**: Timeline extension
**Mitigation**: Early informal review with steering group members, iterative approach

### Risk: Work streams cannot accommodate mitigation embedding
**Impact**: Mitigations not properly integrated
**Mitigation**: Document constraints, propose alternatives, escalate to VIBE-98 if needed

## Assumptions
- SOW030 work streams have capacity to embed mitigations
- AI Steering Group will provide timely feedback
- Work stream leads have authority to commit
- Existing SOW030 governance can accommodate CATH requirements
- VIBE-96 mitigations are stable and documented

## Constraints
- 5-week timeline for first draft submission
- No additional budget for new tools or resources
- Must work within existing SOW030 governance structures
- Limited availability of work stream leads
- AI Steering Group meeting schedule

## Definition of Done

- Integration points documentation complete with all fields populated
- First draft governance package submitted to AI Steering Group
- Presentation delivered and feedback documented
- All work stream leads briefed and acknowledged alignment
- Stakeholder feedback log maintained with all action items tracked
- SOW030 leads have confirmed alignment in writing
- No outstanding critical questions from steering group on approach
