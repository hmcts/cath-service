## Technical Decisions

**Evidence Standards**: Use credible, peer-reviewed sources for academic evidence; reputable industry sources for market research; rigorous measurement for internal data.

**Statistical Approach**: Where possible, use inferential statistics to assess significance; clearly label descriptive vs. inferential findings.

**Update Frequency**: Monthly updates balance freshness with effort; more frequent if major milestones or findings emerge.

**Narrative Balance**: Blend quantitative data with qualitative insights for compelling story; use visuals effectively.

## Evidence Quality Criteria

**Academic Research**:
- Peer-reviewed publications preferred
- Recent studies (last 5 years) prioritized
- Methodology clearly documented
- Sample sizes adequate
- Limitations acknowledged

**Market Research**:
- Reputable sources (Gartner, Forrester, major vendors)
- Methodology transparent
- Sample composition appropriate
- Date of research clear
- Conflicts of interest disclosed

**Internal Data**:
- Measurement methodology documented
- Baseline established before intervention
- Consistent measurement over time
- Sample bias minimized
- Statistical significance assessed
