# VIBE-97: Working with SOW030 to embed mitigations - Specification

## Problem Statement
Working with SOW030 work streams to embed mitigations - Share first draft with AI Steering group on first draft.

## User Story
**AS A** Project Manager
**I WANT** to collaborate with SOW030 work streams to embed risk mitigations into their deliverables
**SO THAT** risk management is integrated across the broader program and mitigations are consistently applied

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SOW030 work streams identified and mapped to relevant mitigations
- [ ] Engagement plan created for each SOW030 work stream
- [ ] Mitigation embedding approach documented for each work stream
- [ ] First draft of collaboration plan shared with AI Steering Group
- [ ] Feedback from AI Steering Group incorporated
- [ ] Work stream leads briefed and committed to embedding mitigations
- [ ] Progress tracking mechanism established

## Technical Context
SOW030 likely refers to a Statement of Work covering multiple parallel work streams within the broader AI/digital transformation program. This ticket involves cross-team coordination to ensure VIBE coding mitigations are appropriately embedded in related work.

## SOW030 Work Streams (To be identified)
Examples may include:
- AI Platform Development
- Data Infrastructure
- Security and Compliance
- Testing and Quality Assurance
- Training and Documentation
- Infrastructure and DevOps

## Collaboration Approach

### 1. Work Stream Mapping
- Identify all SOW030 work streams
- Map VIBE-96 mitigations to relevant work streams
- Identify overlap and dependencies
- Determine primary and secondary owners

### 2. Engagement Strategy
- Schedule initial meetings with work stream leads
- Present relevant mitigations and rationale
- Understand work stream delivery plans
- Identify integration points
- Agree on shared responsibilities

### 3. Embedding Mechanisms
- **Policy Integration**: Ensure mitigations reflected in policies/standards
- **Process Integration**: Embed in workflows and procedures
- **Technical Integration**: Include in architecture and design
- **Governance Integration**: Add to review and approval gates

### 4. Documentation Requirements
For each work stream:
- Mitigations to be embedded
- Integration approach
- Responsible parties
- Timeline and milestones
- Success criteria
- Dependencies and risks

## AI Steering Group Review
- Prepare first draft of collaboration plan
- Include work stream mapping and engagement strategy
- Highlight cross-cutting mitigations
- Identify areas requiring governance support
- Request feedback and guidance

## Out of Scope
- Delivering mitigations not covered by SOW030 (covered in VIBE-98)
- Implementation of specific mitigations (execution phase)
- Detailed technical specifications for each work stream

## Dependencies
- VIBE-96: Mitigations must be documented first
- Access to SOW030 documentation and work stream plans
- Availability of work stream leads for collaboration
- AI Steering Group schedule for review
