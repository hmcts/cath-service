# VIBE-99: KPI04 Evidential Pack using academic and market research - Specification

## Problem Statement
KPI04 Evidential Pack using academic and market research - first draft in mid October and then updated as experience reflects until Nov/Dec.

## User Story
**AS A** Program Lead
**I WANT** to create an evidential pack for KPI04 using academic and market research
**SO THAT** we can demonstrate the effectiveness and impact of the VIBE coding initiative with credible evidence

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] KPI04 defined with clear success criteria
- [ ] Academic research sources identified and reviewed
- [ ] Market research data collected and analyzed
- [ ] First draft of evidential pack completed
- [ ] Initial evidence baseline established
- [ ] Pack includes quantitative and qualitative evidence
- [ ] Document updated regularly with project experience data
- [ ] Final version completed incorporating Nov/Dec learnings
- [ ] Pack suitable for governance and stakeholder presentation

## Technical Context
KPI04 likely refers to a Key Performance Indicator for the VIBE program, possibly measuring:
- Developer productivity with AI coding tools
- Code quality improvements
- Time savings
- Error reduction
- Developer satisfaction
- Return on investment

The evidential pack must combine external research with internal project data to build a compelling case.

## KPI04 Definition
(To be confirmed with stakeholders)

**Possible KPI04**: "Increase developer productivity by X% through AI-assisted coding while maintaining or improving code quality"

**Success Metrics**:
- Productivity: Lines of code, features delivered, time to completion
- Quality: Bug rates, security vulnerabilities, code review findings
- Satisfaction: Developer surveys, adoption rates
- Efficiency: Cost per feature, resource utilization

## Evidence Sources

### 1. Academic Research
- **Peer-reviewed studies** on AI coding assistants
- **University research** on developer productivity
- **Academic papers** on code quality and AI
- **Meta-analyses** of AI tool effectiveness
- **Theoretical frameworks** for productivity measurement

Key areas to research:
- GitHub Copilot effectiveness studies
- AI code generation accuracy
- Developer cognitive load with AI tools
- Code review effectiveness for AI-generated code
- Long-term quality impacts

### 2. Market Research
- **Industry reports** from Gartner, Forrester, IDC
- **Vendor case studies** from GitHub, OpenAI, etc.
- **Industry surveys** on AI adoption
- **Benchmarking data** from similar organizations
- **Market trends** and forecasts

Key questions:
- What productivity gains are others seeing?
- What quality impacts are reported?
- What adoption challenges exist?
- What ROI are organizations achieving?

### 3. Internal Project Data
- **Baseline measurements** before VIBE implementation
- **Ongoing metrics** during VIBE project
- **Developer feedback** and surveys
- **Code quality metrics** comparison
- **Incident and defect data**
- **Cost and resource data**
