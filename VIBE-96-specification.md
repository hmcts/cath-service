# VIBE-96: Updated mitigations associated with vibe-coding risks - Specification

## Problem Statement
Updated mitigations within the same risks document - Put in SharePoint to be able to be updated over rest of project.

## User Story
**AS A** Project Manager
**I WANT** to document and maintain mitigation strategies for identified VIBE coding risks
**SO THAT** the project team has clear actions to reduce risk exposure throughout the project

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Each risk from VIBE-95 has corresponding mitigation strategies documented
- [ ] Mitigations include specific actions, owners, and timelines
- [ ] Mitigation effectiveness is measurable with clear success criteria
- [ ] Document integrated within the risks register in SharePoint
- [ ] Stakeholders can track mitigation progress and status
- [ ] Regular review process established for mitigation effectiveness

## Technical Context
This extends VIBE-95 by adding the mitigation strategies to the risks register. The same SharePoint document will be updated to include comprehensive mitigation plans.

## Mitigation Components
For each risk identified in VIBE-95, document:

1. **Mitigation Strategy**
   - Specific actions to reduce likelihood or impact
   - Preventive vs. reactive measures
   - Risk acceptance criteria

2. **Ownership and Accountability**
   - Primary owner responsible for execution
   - Supporting team members
   - Escalation path

3. **Timeline and Milestones**
   - Implementation start and target completion dates
   - Key milestones and checkpoints
   - Dependencies on other mitigations

4. **Success Criteria**
   - Measurable indicators of effectiveness
   - Target risk level after mitigation
   - Monitoring and reporting mechanisms

5. **Resources Required**
   - Budget implications
   - Team capacity
   - External dependencies or support

## Mitigation Categories

### Technical Risk Mitigations
- Code review processes and standards
- Automated testing and quality gates
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Technical debt management approach

### Delivery Risk Mitigations
- Buffer time in schedules
- Resource contingency plans
- Dependency management protocols
- Scope management and change control

### Security Risk Mitigations
- Security scanning and testing
- Penetration testing schedule
- Access control implementation
- Audit logging requirements

### Compliance Risk Mitigations
- Regular compliance checks
- Accessibility testing approach
- Policy adherence verification
- AI governance alignment

## Integration with Risk Register
- Mitigations added as columns/sections in existing document
- Visual indicators for mitigation status (Not Started, In Progress, Complete)
- Links between risks and related mitigations
- RAG status for each mitigation

## Out of Scope
- Implementation of the mitigations (execution is separate)
- Embedding mitigations with SOW030 work streams (covered in VIBE-97)
- Delivery of specific mitigations (covered in VIBE-98)
- Automated tracking systems

## Dependencies
- VIBE-95: Risks register must be created first
- Access to SharePoint document
- Stakeholder input on mitigation strategies
